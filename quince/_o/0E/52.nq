The quarry was recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.12) surveyed in 1880-81 as \"Old Quarry\", suggesting that the quarry was by that date out of use. The quarry measured some 72 metres from east to west by 55 metres north-south and had a working face on its western side. The site was subsequently developed for Horfield Prison."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
