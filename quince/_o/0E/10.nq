On the basis of the excavated material, the farm was probably in existence by the end of the 1st century AD and survived until the 4th century AD. A flue, an earth-bonded stone wall and ditches were recorded. Sampling produced evidence for arable cultivation and grassland.\r\nParts of the site are known to be preserved beneath landscaping in the playing fields (Parker 1984)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
