The piggery was constructed at the end of the nineteenth century and is first recorded by the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.06) published in 1903. It is a single-storey building, measuring approximately 5.5 metres from east to west and 8 metres north to south. The piggery is constructed of coursed Pennant sandstone rubble with ashlar quoins and details with a pitched roof. It was extended in the later twentieth century by the addition of pre-fabricated concrete structures on its east side and converted to changing rooms. The interior is reported to have been remodelled."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
