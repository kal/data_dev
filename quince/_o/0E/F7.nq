The playhouse was owned by Nicholas Wolfe, cutler and was at a location which is uncertain, probably a tenement on the north side of the street (backing on to the south wall of Christ Church (BUAD 33M)), probably No.6 1/2, which was in the possession of Wolfe by the late sixteenth-century. Wolfe occupied this property in 1589 and carried out alterations to it including \"the rearinge up higher\" (BRO 04421(a) quoted in Leech 1997, 172). He renewed his lease in 1598 and this allowed him \"to Newe buylde the said Tenemente and everye parte thereof with thappurtenances within fowre yearees nexte ensuinge the date hereof...\" (quoted in Pilkington 1983, 14). The records of lawsuits in the Public Record Office (Pilkinton 1988) suggest that the theatre was in use by late 1604 or early 1605 and remained a playhouse until 1625, despite Wolfe's death in 1614. It appears that part of the building remained in domestic use, with some players staying there while performing in the city. The rooms were also let to \"comedyantes\". Under the terms of Wolfe's will annuities were granted to six Bristol charities out of the profits of the venture \"for longe only as the same house shall continewe a playe house...\" (quoted in Pilkinton 1988, 73). Jones (1988, 207) quotes an entry in the Treasurer's Book of Queen Elizabeth's Hospital which records receipt of £1 10s 0d for one year's rent \"out of the Playhouse in Wyne Street, which was given by Nicholas Woolfe, cutler, to remain to the Hospital for ever.\"\r\nThe building passed into the possession of Anthony Bassett, tailor, and then through a number of hands including, successively, pewterers, a surgeon, and an upholsterer. By the mid eighteenth-century part of the property was in use as a dwelling while the another part was a shop.\r\nThe building would seem to been extant until c.1782 when the lease was assigned to the feoffees of Christ Church to facilitate the rebuilding of the church. Illustrations of Wine Street in the Braikenridge Collection suggest that the buildings against the church were rebuilt, or at least refronted, during the late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
