<http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/resource/monument_record_no/2742M> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/definition/monument_desc> "Eastfield Quarry, located on the southern side of Southmead Road. The quarry was extant by the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.08) published in 1881 and measured approximately 195 metres from north-east to south-west at that date. There was also a limekiln (SMR 3932) at its northern end.\r\nThe quarry was apparently no longer being worked by the end of the First World War and part at the southern end had been infilled by the end of the First World War. The remainder has since been infilled and the site now forms open space on the western side of Henleaze Road. Buildings associated with quarry on Southmead Road, together with the limekiln, are extant."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
