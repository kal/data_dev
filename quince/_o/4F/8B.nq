Ground-floor raised above what is probably a high cellar but could be a sunken ground-floor. Twin sashes to the raised storey. Full-width pentice roof over. First-floor segmental-headed sash windows. Cross-windows to attic, with some timber-framing visible to the front. Lateral stack on west wall, with twin pots. The building was rebuilt on the same site to form the present building."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
