The arch was constructed in the early-eighteenth century as part of an avenue of trees (SMR 21899) leading from Cotham Road to Redland Court (SMR 3973) and framed the house from Cotham Road while terminating the view from the house to the south-east. It is not currently (23/03/2004) clear whether the arch is of the same date as Redland Court or was constructed as part of Thomas Paty's scheme for the addition of pavilions to the house. It was not recorded by Jean Rocque's 1742 plan of Bristol but was, however, in existence by April 1746 when it was drawn by James Stewart (SMR 21901). The arch consisted of a central segmental arch with ashlar voussoirs and a cornice with crenellations above. On the north-east and south-west sides were flanking walls (without crenellation) reaching to the height of the springing of the central arch. These were terminated with two rusticated square columns with pyramidal heads. Between the rusticated bands there were narrow slits. The arch was orientated from south-west to north-east and was approximately 20 metres long and appears to have been around four metres high. It was still in existence in the late 1820s and was recorded by John Plumley and George Ashmead's 1828 plan of Bristol as a \"castellated arch\" (SMR 21900). The arch had been demolished by the early 1880s and its site now lies mainly beneath the highway of Cotham Grove."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
