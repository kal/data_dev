The dock lay at the bottom of Jacobs Wells Road. It was built into a pill at the bottom of Woodwell Lane (modern Jacobs Wells Road) reputedly in 1626. A document of October 1710 records the lease from the Society of Merchant Venturers of \"a house lately built by . John Evans . and also all that piece of void ground on part whereof a dock lately made by him..\" (quoted in Insole 1998) but it is not clear whether this was a mud dock operating in the pill or a dry dock. However, Rocque's 1742 map of Bristol records the dock as a dry dock though indicates no ancillary buildings. The dock passed to Edward Blandy in 1712 and the lease was assigned to Captain Joseph Osborne in 1721. The Osborne family sold the lease to John Roach in 1794 but by 1809 the dock was in the hands of Hilhouse and Company. Paintings of the dock from the opposite side of the Floating Harbour (BSRMG M2961; BRMSG M2942) indicate that substantial buildings had been erected to the west of the dock by 1822. By the 1850s the dock was leased to Charles Hill. The dock was too small to accommodate most ships of the period and as a result the dock gates ceased to function. Consequently the dock was out of use for ten years in the 1870s. It was extended to landward in the early 1880s and a new steel caisson inserted. It was extended again in 1893. The dock and its buildings were sold to the Great Western Railway for £5000 at the end of the nineteenth century to allow the extension of the Harbour railway (McGrath 1975, 345).\r\nThe western wall of the dock and part of the buildings to its west were archaeologically excavated in 1998 (BUAD 3398) (Cox 1999). Sections of the eastern dock wall was located by trial pits dug by the groundworks contractor during the redevelopment of the site in the same year in order to incorporate the upper parts of the walls into the development."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
