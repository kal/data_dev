The palace was established by Bishopric of Worcester to administer its estates in Bristol (including the manor of Henbury) and the Cotswolds (Emery 2000, 463). The precise date that the palace was founded is currently unknown but Ralph Bigland reports it to have been in existence soon after the Norman Conquest of 1066 (Frith 1990, 717). It was certainly in existence by the later fourteenth century and the Book of Margery Kempe describes her visit to the palace (SMR 9649), probably in the summer of 1417 (Windeatt 1994, 146).\r\nThe site of the palace is unknown but it appears to have been very close to the church of St. Mary the Virgin (SMR 5737) (Windeatt 1994, 146). It is likely therefore to have stood to the east of the church, either in the grounds of Henbury Manor or of the vicarage. However, Bigland, writing in the eighteenth century, noted that \"ruinous Buildings near the Church seem to mark the Site of the Palace\" (Frith 1990, 717)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
