The wall was constructed in the thirteenth century and ran from the Quay Head at Small Street to Newgate. There were a number of interval towers and two gates - Frome Gate (BUAD 1212M) and Nether Pithay Gate (BUAD 947M) - which controlled the access to the crossings over the river."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
