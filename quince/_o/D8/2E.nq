The building was constructed in 1909 to a design by the architects W. V. Gough and A. R. Gough. It is a three-storey structure with a double pile plan and pitched pantile roofs with a central valley. The main, north-facing, elevation is of brick and has five bays. The ground floor has arched entrance openings at either end, that at the eastern end being double width with entrance into the building. The fenestration of the upper floors comprised metal windows in large arched openings. The rear elevation is of similar design and construction although the side walls are of stone rubble bonded in a lime mortar, and appear to have been elements of earlier structures (BUAD 1542M) incorporated into the new warehouse.Internally the warehouse is a single space at each storey, with the wooden floors supported on moulded cast iron columns. The roof structure comprises two pairs of braced king post roof trusses.\r\nBy the mid-twentieth century the building was occupied by the Central Shopfitting Company Ltd. and was a saw mill and cabinet factory."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
