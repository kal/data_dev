The reservoir was a structure measuring 45 metres from north-west to south-east by 40 metres wide and had earth banks. The reservoir was built for the Bristol Water Works Company in the early decades of the twentieth century and there was a single-storey pumping station (SMR 22437) and a water tower (SMR 22438) close to its south-east corner. The reservoir was apparently demolished in the early 1990s and the site redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/data_dev/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
